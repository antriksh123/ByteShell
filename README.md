# ByteShell

ByteShell is a simple Linux shell implementation written in C++. It provides a command-line interface where users can execute commands, navigate the file system, and perform basic shell operations.

## Description

A Linux shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, interpreting user input and executing the corresponding actions.

ByteShell aims to replicate the functionality of a basic Linux shell. It provides a set of commands that users can enter to perform tasks such as navigating the file system, displaying information, and terminating the shell. The `cd` command allows users to change directories, `echo` displays text on the shell, `pwd` prints the current working directory, and exit terminates the shell.

The shell also includes basic error handling to notify users if a command is not recognized or if a file or directory does not exist. Additionally, ByteShell provides a prompt to indicate that it is ready to accept user input.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using the command: `g++ -o shell shell.cpp`
4. Run the shell executable: `./shell`
5. The ByteShell prompt will appear, and you can start entering commands.
6. **Note** - You need to update the paths used in the current according to your local environment.

## Supported Commands

ByteShell supports the following commands:

- `cd ~`: Change to the user's home directory.
- `cd /`: Change to the root directory.
- `cd`: Change to the default directory (C:\Users\Antriksh in your implementation).
- `cd .`: Stay in the current directory.
- `cd ..`: Move up one directory.
- `cd ar`: Change to the directory named "ar" if it exists.
- `cd arg1/arg2`: Change to the subdirectory "arg2" within the directory "arg1".

- `echo abc`: Display "abc" on the shell.
- `echo -n abc`: Display "abc" on the shell without a trailing newline.
- `echo “abc”`: Display "abc" on the shell.
- `echo -E ab\c`: Display "ab\c" on the shell without interpreting backslashes.

- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.

- `exit`: Terminate the shell.

## Tech Stack Used

- C++
- Standard Library
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## The working

ByteShell operates by accepting user input in the form of commands. Here's an overview of how each command works:

- **Change Directory (`cd`)**: The `cd` command allows users to change the current directory. ByteShell supports various options for navigating the file system. Users can change to the user's home directory (`cd ~`), root directory (`cd /`), or move up one directory (`cd ..`). Additionally, users can change to a specific directory by entering its name (`cd directory_name`). If the directory does not exist, ByteShell displays an appropriate error message.

- **Echo (`echo`)**: The `echo` command displays text on the shell. ByteShell supports different options for echoing text. Users can display text (`echo "Hello, world!"`), display text without a trailing newline (`echo -n "Hello"`), or disable the interpretation of backslashes (`echo -E "ab\c"`). ByteShell also handles cases where a user input spans multiple lines, allowing for continued input with the `>` prompt.

- **Print Working Directory (`pwd`)**: The `pwd` command prints the current working directory. ByteShell retrieves the current working directory using the `getcwd()` function and displays it on the shell.

- **Exit**: The `exit` command terminates the shell and exits the program.

## Key Takeaways

ByteShell provides a starting point for understanding how a basic shell works. It demonstrates concepts such as parsing user input, executing commands, and interacting with the file system. The project can be extended to include more advanced shell features and functionalities.
